# Machine Learning Model Development

This project demonstrates the implementation of various machine learning models using popular Python libraries such as NumPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The models are built, trained, and evaluated for tasks such as prediction, binary classification, and multi-class classification.

## Key Features

- **Supervised Learning Models:**  
  Build and train machine learning models for both prediction and binary classification tasks, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  (Using NumPy & scikit-learn)

- **Neural Networks with TensorFlow:**  
  Develop and train a neural network for performing binary-class classification tasks.
  Develop and train a neural network for performing multi-class classification tasks.

- **Decision Trees and Ensemble Methods:**  
  Implement decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees, for various classification and regression tasks.

- **Best Practices:**  
 Practiced multiple labs for machine learning development to ensure models generalize well to real-world data and tasks.
